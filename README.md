The Problem of Time
Time remains one of the most fundamental yet enigmatic concepts in both physics
and philosophy. While classical physics treats time as an independent dimension
flowing uniformly and absolutely, relativity revealed its observer-dependent
nature. Quantum mechanics further complicated our understanding by introducing
measurement-dependent temporal effects. Despite these advances, contemporaryphysics still largely treats time as an external parameter rather than an emergent
phenomenon.
The subjective experience of time presents additional challenges. Consciousness
studies have documented numerous ways in which time perception varies—during
meditation, dreams, trauma, or altered states—yet lacks a unified mathematical
framework to explain these variations. The disconnect between physical time and
experienced time represents a significant gap in our understanding of reality.

The Continuous Oscillatory Model (COM) offers a radical reconceptualization of
physical reality. Unlike standard models that begin with spacetime and matter,
COM posits energy as the only fundamental reality, with space emerging as wave
amplitude, time as wave frequency, and mass as energy density patterns. This
framework eliminates the concept of vacuum, replacing it with an omnipresent
energy field structured according to specific mathematical principles.
